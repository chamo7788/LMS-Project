When I talk to him it’s like I’m talking to the carbon monoxide detector, the police scanner, the video recorder on my phone, but he’s never ever with me in person. I think he is even lying to me on what he looks like. I don’t know what to do because I’m like totally in love with this guy. I know what love is too because I have been smitten by the love bug in the past. He hurts me day in and day out by me imagining him with other women. Call me a freak, yes, I probably am but I have had a lot of trouble with past trust issues due to cheating. Tonight I found out about a co-worker he wants to leave me for. Talk about another blow. I am so extremely hurt by this that I can’t scarcely breathe. I don’t know what to do. Honestly I don’t want to call it quits but I see no other way because how can I compete with a woman he sees day in and day out when I’m crazy, poor, and haven’t seen him? I know you’re going to tell me just to forget him. I know I probably should. Any advice on how to heal a broken heart?",
